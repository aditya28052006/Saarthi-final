# 07 — Current Decisions (Decision Log)

> **Log of important decisions made during this session.** Each decision lists *Decision, Reason, Consequence*. Do not silently reverse these without updating this log.

---

### 1. Sangrur Six-Block Legacy Bhuvan Geography

**Decision:** Use **exactly 6 legacy Bhuvan/ISRO blocks** (`Dhuri, Lehra, Malerkotla, Moonak, Sangrur, Sunam`) from `sangrur_blocks_bhuvan.gpkg:184320` layer `sangrur_blocks` as the **authoritative, sole spatial unit** for the prototype.

**Reason:** SIH prototype was already established on the legacy 6-block representation; the current 8-block administrative structure would change the spatial join, the `6×` block-level samples, and all downstream joins. The synthetic `sangrur_blocks.shp:916` was only a temporary test artifact.

**Consequence:** All zonal stats, maps, and `6×` joins use `b_name` from the GPKG (`MultiPolygon` irregular, `12-28` pixels/block varying). The 8-block dataset must be ignored unless explicitly instructed.

---

### 2. Bhuvan GeoPackage as Authoritative Boundary (Not Synthetic Shapefile)

**Decision:** `data/raw/boundaries/sangrur_blocks_bhuvan.gpkg:184320` (`6` `MultiPolygon`, `OGC:CRS84`, `75.55-76.20`) is the **authoritative** boundary. `sangrur_blocks.shp:916` (`Polygon ×6` rectangular `48` uniform) remains in the repo **only as a fallback/test artifact** and must **not** be used by `01`/`02` pipelines (both now explicitly prefer `*_bhuvan.gpkg`).

**Reason:** The Bhuvan parcel `bhuvan_blocks.parquet:97298502` (6393 national, 74 Punjab) filtered `s_name=="Punjab" AND d_name=="Sangrur"` was verified to produce exactly the 6 expected blocks with correct names and irregular geometries. The synthetic grid was `75.55-76.45` 2×3 rectangles, not administrative.

**Consequence:** `01` `c11_load_boundaries:1` and `02` `c3_boundaries:1` now do `gpd.read_file(bhuvan_gpkg, layer="sangrur_blocks")` and log `Using AUTHORITATIVE GeoPackage`. All `12-28` varying pixel counts prove real admin is used.

---

### 3. CHIRPS v3 as Observed / Ground Truth

**Decision:** Use **CHIRPS v3** `data/raw/rainfall/Sangrur_Block_Daily_Rainfall_2010_2025.csv:3804691` (`35064` rows `2010-01-01` to `2025-12-31`, `6` per date) as the **sole observed rainfall source** for both historical features (≤`D`) and the **target** `target_7d = sum D+1..D+7`.

**Reason:** CHIRPS v3 is the `0.05°` quasi-global, 40+ year, `60N-60S` dataset on which CHIRPS-GEFS is calibrated (`c3g_` = CHIRPS3-GEFS). It is already aggregated to the 6 Sangrur blocks, continuous (no missing dates), and validated in `02` `Cell 13`.

**Consequence:** `02` `Cell 14` must validate `D+1..D+7` all have 6 blocks; early `2001-2009` `D` are automatically `invalid` (no CHIRPS target yet) — `8758→5472` valid. The intended `2001–2019` train must be **restricted to `2010–2019`** unless earlier CHIRPS is acquired.

---

### 4. CHIRPS-GEFS v3 Daily as Forecast Predictor

**Decision:** Use **CHIRPS-GEFS v3 daily** `https://data.chc.ucsb.edu/products/CHIRPS-GEFS/v3/daily/global/YYYY/MM/DD/c3g_YYYY.MM.DD.tif` (`7200×2400×1` `64.9 MB` `float32` `EPSG:4326`) as the **most important predictor**.

**Reason:** It is the CHIRPS-calibrated GEFS forecast (`c3g`), bias-corrected, `0.05°`, `60N-60S`, with pre-2000 reformats and operational `2000–2019` + `2021–2025` archive (2020 gap) — directly comparable to CHIRPS.

**Consequence:** Historical system simulates `At D, use GEFS issued on D, compare to CHIRPS D+1..D+7`. Archive is date-based folders with `c3g_YYYY.MM.DD.tif` per date.

---

### 5. Seven-Day Primary Target

**Decision:** **Primary target is 7-day accumulated observed rainfall** `target_7d_rainfall_mm = sum CHIRPS D+1..D+7` per `forecast_date+block`. `D` itself **must NOT** be included, nor `D+8`.

**Reason:** SIH asks for 7–30 day hyperlocal outlook; 7-day is the focused prototype that balances skill and demo feasibility. A 7-day window is also the most actionable for agricultural advisories.

**Consequence:** `02` `Cell 28` builds `target_7d` with `target_start = D+1`, `target_end = D+7`, requires 7 valid days, `target_valid=False` if any missing (no zero fill). Secondary `target_10d` only if core 7-day works.

---

### 6. Shared Model Across Six Blocks with `lat/lon`

**Decision:** Train **one shared model** across all 6 blocks, not 6 independent models. Represent spatial differences via `centroid latitude, longitude` (from `sangrur_blocks_bhuvan.gpkg`) + soil.

**Reason:** `PROJECT_CONTEXT` explicitly says *do not initially train six completely independent models*; a shared model can learn `history + forecast + ENSO + season + location + soil` jointly.

**Consequence:** `Notebook 03` will add `latitude, longitude` per block; block ID is not the only spatial feature.

---

### 7. Recent Rainfall Features (≤D Only)

**Decision:** Later `Notebook 03` will add `rain_1d, rain_3d, rain_7d, rain_14d, rain_30d` (sums ending at `D`) and `rain_lag_1..7` (`rain_lag_1 = D, ..., rain_lag_7 = D-6`).

**Reason:** Recent observed rainfall is a strong predictor, but must be **strictly ≤D** to avoid leakage.

**Consequence:** For `D=2019-09-04`, `rain_7d = sum 2019-08-29..2019-09-04`, never `2019-09-05`.

---

### 8. Chronological Validation (No Random Split)

**Decision:** **Never randomly shuffle** `forecast_date`. Use **chronological** splits, keep `2020` excluded.

**Intended (adapted to `2010` CHIRPS start):** `2010–2019` train / `2021–2023` val / `2024–2025` test (original `2001–2019` train is truncated to `2010–2019` because `2001-2009` has no target). `CANDIDATE_DATES 8758 → VALID_DATES 5472` already enforces chronological, `2020` excluded, `D+7 ≤ 2025-12-31`.

**Reason:** Time series with seasonality and autocorrelation; random split leaks future `D+1..D+7` into train via overlapping windows.

**Consequence:** `Notebook 04` will do `df[year <=2019]` etc., no `train_test_split(random_state=)`.

---

### 9. RF / XGBoost / LightGBM Candidates, No Winner Yet

**Decision:** Compare **Climatology, Persistence, Raw GEFS** baselines vs **Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM** — all tabular tree models. **No model declared winner yet.**

**Reason:** `PROJECT_CONTEXT` says choose on **unseen chronological test performance** (`MAE/RMSE/R²` + `Accuracy/F1/log loss/Brier`), not on popularity. Deep learning is explicitly **not** part of core prototype unless core is complete and substantial time remains.

**Consequence:** `Notebook 04` will train all 6 and select objectively.

---

### 10. CSV + Parquet for `Cell 35`

**Decision:** `Cell 35` saves **both** `data/processed/forecast_features_base.csv:1294` and `.parquet:5982` (and `01` saves both for `chirps_gefs_sangrur_*`).

**Reason:** User explicitly requested `csv + parquet` — Parquet is the preferred downstream format (efficient), CSV is human-readable/debugging/export.

**Consequence:** `Notebook 03` can read either; Parquet is preferred for `32k` rows.

---

### 11. Explicit `NaN` for `gefs_d2..d7`

**Decision:** `Cell 35` schema is `forecast_date,block,gefs_d1,gefs_d2,gefs_d3,gefs_d4,gefs_d5,gefs_d6,gefs_d7,target_7d_rainfall_mm` where **`gefs_d1` is real** (from single daily file at `D`), **`gefs_d2..d7` are `NaN`** (not zero, not dropped) — `NaN` means “not available yet, to be filled in Notebook 03 by joining 7 daily files per `D`”.

**Reason:** Current single-daily product has `count 1` (`descriptions (None,)`), not a 7-band stack. `gefs_d2..d7` cannot be invented; `NaN` correctly represents missing, `0` would be wrong (would imply 0 mm forecast).

**Consequence:** `Cell 34` does **not** mark `gefs_d2..d7` all-`NaN` as `FAIL`; it reports `gefs_d1 0 missing PASS` and `gefs_d2..d7 all NaN — expected at this stage (to be filled in Notebook 03)`. `Notebook 03`'s job is to acquire/join the remaining daily files.

---

### 12. Six-Day Scope Constraint

**Decision:** Prioritize **correct pipeline → backtest → baselines → RF/XGB/LGBM → probabilistic → live → dashboard** in six days, in that order. Avoid expanding to `IOD, MJO, ERA5, SMAP, DEM, ECMWF S2S` etc. unless core is complete.

**Reason:** `PROJECT_CONTEXT` explicitly says the prototype must prioritize correct functioning over maximizing datasets.

**Consequence:** `02` `Cells 31–35` are a demo `3` dates (`18` rows) / `4` dates (`24` rows) `forecast_features_base` with `gefs_d1` only, not full `5472` bulk — full `5472` (`346 GB` raw) is a one-time background job with `KEEP_RAW=False`.

---

### 13. No Deep Learning Initially

**Decision:** No deep learning for core prototype.

**Reason:** Tabular `forecast_date+block` with `~32k` samples is well-suited to `RF/XGB/LightGBM`; deep learning adds overhead without clear gain for this prototype and is explicitly excluded in `PROJECT_CONTEXT`.

**Consequence:** If core `01–06` + dashboard are complete and time remains, deep learning could be *considered* as an extension, not a replacement.

---

### 14. Notebook 04 Winner: Raw GEFS (Honest Baseline Win, 2026-09-10)

**Decision:** Declare **Raw GEFS (`gefs_7d_total`)** the winning model (val MAE 19.031, test MAE 19.539) over RF/XGB/LGBM, and report that ML does not add skill on this JJAS task — rather than forcing an ML winner.

**Reason:** Selection was strictly lowest validation MAE per the agreed rule; test confirmed it (RF 20.176 / XGB 21.082 / LGBM 21.344). Hiding this would be dishonest and would corrupt downstream inference.

**Consequence:** `models/best_model.joblib` stores the baseline rule (reload-verified); feature importances shown are the best-ML (XGBoost) supplement, labeled as such. Future work (more seasons, calibrated post-processing) may revisit, but must beat 19.539 test MAE honestly.

---

### 15. Inference Artifacts + Live Pipeline (2026-09-10)

**Decision:** NB04 produces explicit inference artifacts (`best_model.joblib` with `model_type: raw_gefs`, `models/inference_config.json`, `models/probability_calibration.npz` holding the winner's train-residual ECDF + thresholds); NB05 consumes them without refitting anything, branching on `model_type` instead of assuming `.predict(X)`.

**Reason:** The winner is a rule, not an estimator; probabilities must reuse NB04's exact residual-ECDF methodology with train-only parameters. Lead 0 is forbidden by config flag.

**Consequence:** Live issue date D = latest fully-available GEFS bundle (walk-back ≤30d on gaps, else fail loudly); prediction = sum of D+1..D+7 block means; wet day ≥1.0 mm/day is a labeled prototype heuristic; CHIRPS/ENSO/soil are explicitly-flagged context only (NaN + availability flags when local files lag D, never fabricated).

---

### 16. Application Data Contract (2026-09-10)

**Decision:** NB06 packages NB05 output into `data/processed/application/` with Bhuvan-derived block IDs (`bhuvan_b_<b_code>`), static GeoJSON kept separate from dynamic forecast JSON, generic prototype-labeled advisories (no agronomic claims), and Spring Boot fixtures + `docs/api/` contract. No Streamlit/Flask/FastAPI; backend = Spring Boot, frontend = React.

**Reason:** Backend needs a stable, validated, reload-verified contract; geometry and forecast must version independently.

**Consequence:** Spring Boot DTOs bind directly to `latest_forecast.json`/`blocks.json`/`health.json`; React renders map + cards + charts from JSON (CSV is compatibility-only).

---

### 17. Saarthi Full-Stack Integration (2026-09-10)

**Decision:** Integrate the validated NB06 package into the existing Saarthi app (Spring Boot + vanilla HTML/JS/CSS + Leaflet — NO React migration, NO Streamlit/Flask) on branch `real-forecast-integration`, replacing the synthetic engine end-to-end while preserving UI structure.

**Reason:** Round-1 app used hardcoded 8-block data, 0.15 stub probability, pattern-math forecasts and false RF/92.4% claims; the validated contract (`data/processed/application/`) is the2014 fix point.

**Consequence:** New `RealForecastService` (classpath `forecast/` resources, fail-loud validation) is the single source of truth; endpoints `/health /blocks /blocks/geojson /forecast/latest /forecast/{blockId} /forecast/summary /advisories/{blockId} /panchayats /farmer-analysis` serve real data; frontend is fetch-first with 6-block GeoJSON polygons, 7-day-only UI, explicit error messages (no silent synthetic fallback); farmer analysis driven by real P(LOW); verified end-to-end (API + Playwright browser tests, 0 console errors).
